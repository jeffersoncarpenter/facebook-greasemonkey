# facebook-greasemonkey

## Current features:

* Deletes ads on right side.
* Deletes sponsored stories in news feed.
* Selects "Most Recent" stories automatically, in case "Top Stories" are selected.

## Install:

Get Greasemonkey.  Create a new User Script.  Call it anything and put it in any namespace; these will be overwritten.  Edit your new script.  Overwrite the contents of your script with the contents of the .js file in this repository (you might need to type "allow pasting" into the script first).  Save the script.  Refresh Facebook.  You can tell it's working if the ads in the right column are deleted.
